## Author: Mays Al-Raheem

## Overview
This project, Search, is the final project for the Girls Who Code program. It has two versions, each serving as a search tool:

1. **Terminal Version:** In this version, the project interacts with users through the terminal. It fetches data from an API, allowing users to search for recipes, apply filters, and save the results to a CSV file.

2. **Tkinter Version:** In this version, the project provides a graphical user interface using Tkinter. Users can interact with the interface to perform searches, view lists of results, and apply filters.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- `requests` library
- `env` library
- Tkinter (for the Tkinter version)
- CSV

## How to Use
To use the terminal version, simply run the Python script associated with it. Follow the on-screen prompts to search for recipes, apply filters, and save the results.

For the Tkinter version, execute the Python script for the GUI interface. You'll be presented with an interactive interface that allows you to search, filter, and view recipe results.
